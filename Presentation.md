# LED Box Project

<!--
1. Attention grabber
2. What will audience get out of watching/listening to you? Why should they?
3. What is the scope of your presentation (how much are you loading on to the audience)?
4. What was your inspiration? What were your initial ideas? Was there anything you tried but abandoned?
5. What background information, theory or technical details do your audience need to know to be able to understand your show/game?
6. Code (Product)
-   Big picture
-   Important code snippets
-   Bug examples
-   What did you already know (and from where do you know it) and what did you have to learn to complete the project?
7. Code (process)
-   How did you code? Vibe? GitHub?
8. The show/game. Demo and description
9. Conclusion
10. Reflection. What did we get from taking part in this challenge?
11. Final thought/take-home message

## Outline

## 1. (Attention Grabber)

<!--
Talk is cheap. Show me the code - Linus Torvalds

Never trust a computer you can't throw out a window - Steve Wozniak

It doesn't (yet?) run Doom.

## 2. Presentation Objectives

Show you what we programmed, how we did it, and what we learned.

## 3. Outline / Ideas

We had many ideas:

-   a Falling Sand Simulation
-   a Presentation Screen
-   3 body problem simulation
-   slither.io clone

<table style="background-color:rgb(81, 81, 71); border: 2px solid rgb(98, 98, 91); margin-left: 0; padding: 8px">
	<tr>
		<td style="white-space: nowrap; padding-left:24px; text-align: left; font-size: 1.2em; color: #ffffff;">
			The final idea was to program <strong>
				<span style="color: #6c63ff;">T</span>
				<span style="color: #f44336;">E</span>
				<span style="color: #ffeb3b;">T</span>
				<span style="color: #4caf50;">R</span>
				<span style="color: #2196f3;">I</span>
				<span style="color: #ff9800;">S</span>
			</strong>, <br>but that escalated <em>quickly</em>!

## 4. Inspiration / History of Games

### What are the Games?

## 5. Background Information / Hardware

### LEDs

The here used LED matrix is a `16x16 grid of LEDs`, which can be controlled to display various patterns and animations.
Each LED can be turned on or off, and can also change color since RGB LEDs are used.

### Raspberry Pi

`The Raspberry Pi is used to control the LED matrix. 
It runs the python scripts and handles user input.`

### Python

Programming language used to write the game logic and control the LED matrix.

### Router

The python scripts can be uploaded to the Raspberry Pi through a WiFi connection to a build-in router, inside the LED box

## 6. Codebase

## 11. Outlook

<!--
It will probably never run Doom
