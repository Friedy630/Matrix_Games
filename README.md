TETRIS

#General
  This repository is an emulator for a 16x16 LED screen, on which this tetris game will run eventually. Input will be done using udp over a local wifi.
  The 'remote' and 'display' dependencies have to be swapped with the original (non-emulator) ones, in order to work on the actual LED matrix.

#TODO
  The speed, and the gradual increase of it need to be rebalanced
  Add Game-Over screen
  Add main menu
  Adjust colors
