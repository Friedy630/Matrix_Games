TETRIS

#General
  This repository is an emulator for a 16x16 LED screen for various games, including our initial game tetris.
  Using the actual LED matrix, input will be done using udp over a local wifi, and the 'remote' and 'display' dependencies have to be swapped with the original (non-emulator) ones.

#TODO
  For that, refer to the Projectview 'Tetris'
